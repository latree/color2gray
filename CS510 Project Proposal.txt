Project Proposal

In my CS510 Computational Photography project, I want to choose the topic that turning color image to grayscale image with loosing as least details as it can. The algorithm that I choose is from one of the paper that instructor given which is "Apparent Greyscale: A Simple and Fast Conversion to Perceptually Accurate Images and Video" written by Kaleigh Smith and his team. By applying this algorithm, I am going to implement this algorithm in C++ using OpenCV. My expectation would be self-implement the algorithm that discussed in paper, and try to make it work in small or medium size picture. I intend to try only implement the algorithm for image processing and not the section for video since it is going to be too hard to implement both at the same time. In my point of view the algorithm that I implement should create a perceptually accurate version of the color image that represents its psychophysical effect on a viewer. I will try to implement algorithm that works on small image. After I achieve, I will try to apply my implementation to a medium or large image to see the runtime performance. The paper also has some limitations that multi-scale local contrast enhancement reintroduces lost discontinuities only in regions that insufficiently represent original chromatic contrast. I am not sure how far I will go for this limitation, but I will try my best to think deep for the limitations in paper.
